When Robert Allen Zimmerman picked up an electric guitar is 1965 at [Newport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy), his performance was said to have "electrified one half of his audience, and electrocuted the other". The (not so) recent Nobel prize for the man himself seems to be raising a similar debate - not for me though, I was elated…. till the world decided there were alternative facts to get divided about. But I digress. The point is, the notion of Two-Speed IT (or Bimodal IT, or multi-velocity IT, or "pick a set of words which sound cool and fashionable but complex" IT) seems to be doing the same to the esteemed set of IT Operating Model, IT Organizational Design, and IT Architecture thinkers. Which brings me to the question - was the question really to adopt Two-speed or not, or was this more of a proverbial "it depends" question? (Just to clarify, in case you invest your time reading this article solely to find that out, I am not exactly privy to Bob Dylan's views on Two-speed IT, and not entirely sure he actually has one - but I digress, again!)

On one hand, we have the proponents of Two-Speed - and it's an impressive list with access to C-suite - such as [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/bimodal) and [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/a-two-speed-it-architecture-for-the-digital-enterprise). Gartner pretty much coined the notion of bimodal as well as the term itself. There are a bunch of content on Gartner - both paid research and freely available viewpoints, on this. McKinsey, on the other hand, calls it "Two-speed IT", and again has a [ton](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=two-speed+site%3Amckinsey.com) of content and viewpoint, and a lot of it makes quite a bit of sense when you read through them. In particular, I have found [this article](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-enterprise-architects-can-help-ensure-success-with-digital-transformations) to be one of the best reads out there effectively linking two much misrepresented (abused?) concepts and disciplines using real world data and research - Digital Transformation and Enterprise Architecture. Essentially, you'd need to run your IT on two threads - one running nimble, agile programs fast, fail / succeed fast and iterate (such as the ones you call Digital, or stuff you do on the cloud using aaS delivery and consumption models), the one aligning more closely with established Enterprise practices, project and service management processes, governance standards, and delivery methodology, and therefore, on a much slower thread. In the background, you run integration initiatives where you synchronize the two threads with a view of long term Enterprise Architecture and technology portfolio optimization / rationalisation.

Sounds good, so far? It used to make sense to me as well. Till I stumbled upon the viewpoints of a number of esteemed thinkers and industry veterans I closely follow, and I started to notice some of the fallacy. Let's start with Martin Fowler. I swear by [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0321127420), and other stuff Fowler writes. So when I read the term "flawed" on the first line of Fowler's [critique of Bimodal](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BimodalIT.html) and almost calling the concept "Bipolar IT" (ouch!), I had to read through. Fowler's point is - much of the two speed argument associates speed with a system, it's underlying complexity, and therefore it's business agility - which may or may not align with business capabilities and their respective priorities - and is an archaic way of putting technology first while making business decisions. And it got me thinking - and searching. Fowler himself links to another [great perspective](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/10/if-you-really-want-bimodal-then-youll.html) from Simon Wardley, and Wardley's work has been something I consume fervently (I totally recommend visiting these URLs and taking a look for yourself - https://medium.com/@swardley, https://medium.com/wardleymaps, and his blog). The third viewpoint came from Jason Bloomberg, who calls [bimodal a recipe for disaster](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2015/09/26/bimodal-it-gartners-recipe-for-disaster/?sh=2f5684305dd7)! Again, someone whose thoughts around digital transformation has become staple reading material for me, and in my humble opinion, is one of the clear voices in the infinite ocean of noise called "digital". When respected, independent thinkers of this calibre question a paradigm, we ought to take a closer look, right? In the world of management consulting and analyst firms as well, there are doubters - just ask Bain or Forrester. What do they all say? Fowler's point of view, as I mentioned earlier, is that this is a systems-centric or technology-centric view - "these set of systems are hard to change, so we won't do that" vs. a view that really looks at business criticality and value. Secondly, pretty much all of these thinkers disagree with the bimodal recipe's widespread interpretation - that this is a long-term fix for Enterprise IT structure, and is the target / ideal IT operating model for an organization to thrive in the digital age. To quote Bloomberg, this "may be telling CIOs what they want to hear, but not what they need to hear." That it's OK to continue with the "slower speed" delivery of "Enterprise IT", that the backend / digital underbelly does not need to be transformed as a priority. That's gonna change - that's gotta change. The digital transformation agenda may have started with "digital" projects with marketing and customer service or other customer facing functions at the steering wheel - the profound shift is going to be around digital operating model transformation. Digital's impact would be felt through all the organizational building blocks - and eventually disrupt all systems supporting them. While business value generation should remain key to IT portfolio management decisions, operational agility and risk (which really needs to looked as the rapid erosion of value - wanna bet? Wannacry :) ?) would also drive many of these modernization decisions, and in some cases, the existing legacy platforms such as mainframes (again, interesting piece from Bloomberg) could well help in achieving the desired velocity - high-speed. and a two-speed operating model which supports only a set of systems and processes is not going to sustain even in the short-term, i.e. in another few months as a steady state operating model.

So what does all of this mean? Is it all or nothing - do we need to take a look at bimodal / two-speed, or should we not touch it with a ten-feet pole? Do you - the Business or IT leader - have a choice? Having consulted in a number of engagements with similar landscape, and having tried to look at this in the context of my experience - enterprises of various sizes, from various industries, with different priorities and business drivers /aspirations - I think most organizations today are operating in a bimodal / two-speed world. It's just that they may not have given this a formal label - and hence may not have some of the associated structure in place to operate that way. Still, they are actually bimodal / two-speed today, with one stream of work closely working with business, vendors, cloud, IoT, pick your own buzzword, agile delivery models, hopefully making mistakes and learning from them, iterate, and the other sustaining IT investments while ensuring process, system, and services management integration with the other stream.

 It's not the ideal target state, for sure. The ideal target state will be one with full and uniform business agility. But in most IT organizations, or actually in most business organizations, real constraints exist, and usually in the following order:

* Culture - people, both business and IT, are simply accustomed to do things in how it has always worked, and changing that comes from a profound, strategic push in culture from the very top, embracing change and accepting that things - processes, procedures, governance - has to change. At the risk of over quoting Bloomberg, we really need to take a leaf out of DBS's book.
* Risk averse mentality, dogma associated with fail-fast
* Skills - one of the largest gaps to be fixed before business gets the target velocity. Just some interesting findings from HfS research.
* Technology - largely capable at supporting the high-speed IT agenda, except for pending technical debt in underlying platforms

**TL;DR** The lesson for me has been that in such situations, where the business and IT are engaged at executing projects in two-speed setting today, while there is no case for spending cycles formally designing a bimodal operating model (so don’t spend 6 months to get to 23 slides), it does help to set the guiding principles / rules of the road between these workstreams at an organizational / enterprise architecture level - using simple artefacts and models. This would help you to execute your digital projects / programmes with the relevant level of coordination and governance without having to rewrite the rules of engagements for each engagement (do spend a week to put together a set of pragmatic rules of the road, and another to get your leadership to feedback, buy-in and communicate / publish it out). Once that's done, put that in motion embark in the larger mission of digital transformation of moving to one speed of delivery - business at the speed of cloud. Bon voyage!
